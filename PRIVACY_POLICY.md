# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: March 19, 2024

## Overview
This Privacy Policy explains how the YouTube Shorts Blocker extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Collection and Usage
Our extension **does not**:
- Collect any personal information
- Track your browsing activity
- Store any user data on external servers
- Share or sell any information to third parties
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Require user registration or accounts

## Local Storage
The only data stored by this extension is:
- User preferences (such as whether to block Shorts or Playables)
- This data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API
- This data never leaves your device and is only used to remember your settings

## Permissions
The extension requires certain permissions to function:
- Host permission for youtube.com: Required to detect and redirect when users directly visit YouTube Shorts URLs
- ActiveTab: Used to interact with YouTube pages when needed to hide Shorts content
- Scripting: Required to modify YouTube pages to hide Shorts content
- Storage: Used to save your preferences locally

These permissions are used solely for the core functionality of blocking YouTube Shorts and Playables. The host permission is specifically needed to protect users from accessing Shorts content through direct URLs.

- Does not integrate with any third-party services
- Does not send data to external servers
